## 💡 Gameplay and Logic

ASCII Art: The game starts with a large, descriptive ASCII art display for atmosphere.

Path Decisions: The game relies on sequential if/elif/else logic to determine the player's progression and final outcome (winning or losing).

Game Over: Most incorrect choices lead to a "Game Over" scenario, while only one specific sequence of choices leads to success.
