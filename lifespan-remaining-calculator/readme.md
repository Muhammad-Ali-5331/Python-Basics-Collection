# ⏳ Lifespan Remaining Calculator

This console script calculates the time remaining in a person's life based on an assumed maximum lifespan of **90 years**.

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
2.  The program will prompt you to **Enter Your Age in Years**.

## 💡 Calculation Logic

The script determines the remaining time by calculating the difference between 90 and the user's current age. It then converts this remaining time into:

* **Days:** $\text{Years} \times 365$
* **Weeks:** $\text{Years} \times 52$
* **Months:** $\text{Years} \times 12$
