## 📅 Leap Year Checker

This is a simple console script that determines whether a given year is a leap year according to the Gregorian calendar rules.

## 🚀 How to Run

Run the script:
```bash
  python main.py
```
The program will prompt you to Write the year (e.g., 2000, 1900, 2024).

## 💡 Leap Year Rules

The script implements the full set of nested conditions required to accurately classify a year: 

A year must be evenly divisible by 4.

However, if the year is also evenly divisible by 100, it is not a leap year...

...unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400, in which case it is a leap year.
